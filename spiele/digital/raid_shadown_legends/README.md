# RAID - Shadown Legends guide

All following guides are based on this [source](https://ayumilove.net/).

In general, `common` and `uncommon` champions are only food.

Try to keep your gems to build up your gem mine first, followed market and by the guardien ring training slots.

Best place to farm is brutal 12-3.

Only upgrade epic or legendary gears. Upgrade all to 8 if you use it.

Only use gems if you need to finish a task or if there is a special gem event going on, else it is a waste.

# Where to use which champion

Only five or four stars are listed here.

All champions that are worth the effort are listed here and have a dedicated [build guide](champions).

All champions that are not worth the effort are listed [here](champions/not_worth_the_effort.md).
